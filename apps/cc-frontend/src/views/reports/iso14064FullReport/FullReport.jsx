              have established clear organisational and operational boundaries,

              Following the <b>{parameter?.organisationalBoundary}</b> approach,
              we have accounted for 100 per cent of the GHG emissions over which
              we have <b>{parameter?.organisationalBoundary}</b>. This process
              involves identifying and categorising all relevant emission
              sources within our organisational boundaries. We select
              appropriate quantification methodologies for each emission source,

              We collected activity data, such as energy consumption, travel and
              purchases, and applied relevant emission factors to calculate our
              GHG emissions, primarily the appropriate DEFRA/BEIS/DESNZ factors.
              Finally, we consolidated the emissions data to provide a clear and

              databases, including those published annually by DEFRA/BEIS/DESNZ.
              BOM Systems Ltd has independently verified custom emission
              factors. Any changes to published emission factors or updates to
              data sources have been documented and explained in the Annex.

            <Subtitle>4.5 Uncertainties and Accuracy Impacts</Subtitle>
            <Article>
              For each emission source, the activity data quality and the
              corresponding emission factor were rated on a scale ranging from
              Very Good Data Quality (4) to Basic Data Quality (1). By
              calculating the weighted average of these grades, we determined
              the overall quality of each emissions category for each reporting
              year. The details of the data quality categories are in the Annex.

            <Article>
              We are committed to continuously improving our reporting of GHG
              emissions to ensure comprehensive and transparent disclosure. To
              reduce uncertainty in our future greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories,
              we plan to enhance our data collection and monitoring systems to
              ensure that our reporting is more granular and consistent. We also
              want to focus on developing custom emission factors where
              feasible.

            <Article>
              Our base year shows changes in our emissions over time, allowing
              us to conduct comparative analyses in tracking and reporting GHG
              emissions and develop meaningful and consistent comparisons of
              emissions over time.
            </Article>
            <Article>
              Our base year was selected because it is representative and
              provides an accurate reference point for our operations, data
              availability, and organisational structure. It was the first year
              we recorded our emissions in sufficient detail to give a reliable
              emissions figure, and it avoids unusual trading years (such as
              those around COVID-19 or unusual corporate activity).

              Our policy defines a significant change as altering base year

              emissions recalculation policy, we will establish and disclose
              this significance threshold that triggers base year emissions

              If a recalculation is necessary, we will accurately recalculate

              current reporting year, taking into account the identified changes
              or errors, and ensure consistency with the current reporting year.
              We will document the reasons for the recalculation, the steps
              taken, and the impact on the base year emissions data and update
              the GHG inventory.
